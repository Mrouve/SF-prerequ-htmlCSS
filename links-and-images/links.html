  <h1>Links</h1>
  <p>This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.</p>

  <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Absolute links, like to
          <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' target="_blank">Mozilla
              Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web
          developers.</li>
      <!-- Absolute links can be tricky - good practice is to use them mostly for directing towards another website -->
      <!-- To open in a new tab -> target='_blank' -->

      <li>Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras
          page</a>.</li>
      <!-- Relative links imply that scheme (https://) & domain name are the current ones. Only path change-->
      <!-- To access a file in a folder above the current one -> ../../fileName
      In practice, relative links are best for referring to resources in the same folder-->

      <!-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->
      <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website,
          but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
      <!-- Starts by / -->


  </ul>
